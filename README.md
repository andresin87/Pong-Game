# Pong-Game

This project is inspired by [Pontus Alexander](https://twitter.com/pomle) in [Writing a Pong game in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju09womACpQ)'s [youtube's channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8A0M0eDttdB11MHxX58vXQ/videos) called Meth Meth Method. My main motivation is to integrate it in a React project and test the behaviour.
